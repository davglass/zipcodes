Zip Code Lookups
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davglass/zipcodes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davglass/zipcodes)

A localized (flatfile) zipcode lookup.

Zipcode data was taken from here: http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/
Canada Zipcodes data was taken from here: https://www.aggdata.com/download_sample.php?file=ca_postal_codes.csv

It was then transformed into a JSON object and then wrapped with some helper methods.

Usage
-----

    var zipcodes = require('zipcodes');


Zipcode Lookup
--------------

    var hills = zipcodes.lookup(90210);

    { zip: '90210',
      latitude: 34.088808,
      longitude: -118.406125,
      city: 'Beverly Hills',
      state: 'CA' }

Distance
--------

This is not driving distance, it's line of sight distance


    var dist = zipcodes.distance(62959, 90210); //In Miles
    // dist = 1662

    var kilo = zipcodes.toKilometers(dist); //Convert to Kilometers
    // kilo = 2675

    var miles = zipcodes.toMiles(zipcodes.toKilometers(dist)); //Convert to Kilometers, then to miles
    // miles = 1662


Lookup By Name
--------------

*This does not work on the Canada data, the data file doesn't include this much detail.*

    var l = zipcodes.lookupByName('Cupertino', 'CA');
    
    //Always returns an array, since cities can have multiple zip codes
    [ { zip: '95015',
        latitude: 37.323,
        longitude: -122.0527,
        city: 'Cupertino',
        state: 'CA' } ]


Lookup by Radius
----------------

Get all zipcodes within the milage radius of this zipcode

    var rad = zipcodes.radius(95014, 50);
    // rad.length == 385

    [ '93901',
      '93902',
      '93905',
      '93906',
      '93907',
      '93912',
      '93933',
      '93942',
      '93944',
      '93950',
      ...
      '95377',
      '95378',
      '95385',
      '95387',
      '95391' 
    ]


TODO
----

Add support for importing into MongoDB or CouchDB to speed up searchs.

Development
-----------

The original CSV file that I am using for this data is not included in this repo, but I did wrap up
the best way to get the data and how to convert it into the format that this module uses.

To develop with this module, just `make` it and it will fetch the latest zipcodes and reprocess them.

    make

To just fetch and process the zipcodes:

    make codes

To run the very simple test suite:

    make tests
